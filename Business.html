 Mobile software development：
  <br>
 Mobile application development is the process to making software for smartphones and digital assistants, most commonly for Android and iOS. The software can be preinstalled on the device, downloaded from a mobile app store or accessed through a mobile web browser.
  <br>
  <br>
  The role of mobile software development :
  <br>
 The duties and responsibilities of an app developer will depend on the level of experience. Mobile app developer’s primary duty is to create, maintain, and implement the source code to develop mobile apps and mobile platform programs that meet the needs and requirements of the clients using the computer programming languages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Benefits of Mobile software development:
  <br>
1. Huge user base
<br>
The traditional Internet mainly relies on computers, which is inconvenient to use, so the core population is only about 500 million. However, the mobile Internet relies on smart phones, which is convenient to use, so the user base has exceeded 1 billion.
<br>
2. Timeliness
<br>
Compared with computers, it is very convenient to use mobile phones to process things online, which can be carried out anytime, anywhere. It is this convenience that makes the mobile Internet develop rapidly.
<br>
3. Powerful function
<br>
Due to its own limitations, web pages have fewer functions, high requirements for the network, slow loading speed and inconvenient use. The mobile app has very powerful and complete functions, low dependence on the network, fast loading speed and smooth user experience.
<br>
4. Shallow entrance
<br>
Web pages require you to enter the website or rely on search engines, which is very inconvenient to use, especially in the era of mobile Internet, but mobile app is not. Users can use it directly by opening their mobile phones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lack of Mobile software development:
  <br>
 1. High development cost
<br>
In the past, app development was mainly completed by programmers tapping code bit by bit, with high cost, generally starting at 200000. However, with the development of modern technology, Internet Xiaobai can make its own app, saving more than 90% of the cost.
<br>
2. Apply size limit
<br>
Compared with web pages, app can only be used after users download and install it, occupying a certain amount of mobile phone memory space. However, with the development of mobile phone hardware and the continuous expansion of mobile phone memory, the impact on users is becoming smaller and smaller.
