<p style="text-indent:2em;">  
  My name is Matthew. I'm 21 years old. I love sports and travel.I like watching dusk. I am cheerful and optimistic, warm and friendly, hardworking and have strong learning ability. Three years of campus study and life experience has enabled me to accumulate strong organization, coordination and communication skills, team spirit and strong sense of responsibility. Facing the internship opportunities outside the school, I will work hard and seriously, accumulate more relevant work experience, and be able to make significant improvement in dealing with problems during the internship to make myself more mature. Have keen insight into things, many times of social practice experience and experience in students. During the meeting, I exercised my ability to communicate and cooperate with others and my ability to be independent, and worked seriously and responsibly. I study the field of IT knowledge and hope to be able to work in it in the future.
